## LU factorization

### plain LU decomposition

#### definition

A = LU (L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix)

(from wiki)  
LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination

#### Existence and uniqueness

Existence:   <br /> <br />
When satisfied: 1. A is a square matrix.  
A has an LU decomposition _**IF:**_ A can be reduced to row echelon form by Gaussian elimination without ever interchanging two row
 <br /> <br /> <br />
When satisfied: 1. A is a square matrix &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.A is invertible      
A has an LU decomposition _**IF AND ONLY IF:**_ all its leading principal minors are nonzero
 <br /> <br /> <br />
When satisfied: 1. A is a square matrix &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. A is irreversible   
A has an LU decomposition **_IF:_** the first k leading principal minors are nonzero
 <br /> <br /> <br />

Uniqueness:  
the LU factorization is also unique if we require that the diagonal of L(or U) consists of ones.

#### LU Factorization Algorithm

Suppose A can be reduced to an echelon form U using **_only row replacements_** (or A=LU would not exist, you can perform PA = LU)<br/><br/>
So there exist ![](./LU factorization/1.gif)(unit lower triangular elementary matrices) let ![](./LU factorization/2.gif)<br/>
Then ![](./res/3.gif)<br/><br/>
In breif, we can just perform Guassian elimination on A to reduce it into a row echelon form (U); And the same sequence of row operations would reduce L to I 

time complexity: O(N^3)

### LU factorization with partial pivoting (LUP)

background knowledge: 1. for _**square matrix**_, a proper permutation in rows (or columns) is **_sufficient_** for LU factorization.<br/>

So let:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PA = LU  
(P is a permutation matrix, which, when left-multiplied to A, reorders the rows of A, when right-mutiplied to A, reorders the columns of A)
<br/>

### applications

The key to these applications is that the triangular matrix is easy to calculate and has special properties
